# Camera Dashboard Dependencies
# 
# For Raspberry Pi, use system packages instead (recommended):
#   sudo apt install python3-pyqt6 python3-opencv python3-numpy
# Then create venv with: python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
#
# For other systems, install these pinned versions:

# Core dependencies (pinned for reproducibility)
PyQt6==6.7.1
PyQt6-sip==13.8.0
numpy==1.26.4

# NOTE: The PyPI opencv-python package does NOT include GStreamer support.
# On Raspberry Pi, use the system package (python3-opencv) which includes GStreamer.
# On other systems, GStreamer will be unavailable and the app will fall back to V4L2.
# To get GStreamer support elsewhere, build OpenCV from source with -DWITH_GSTREAMER=ON.
opencv-python==4.10.0.84
